### Recomended installation method
The modpack can be successfully installed from the github releases page using the following steps
1. Install the [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) 
> [!NOTE]
> The Prism Launcher is an Open Source minecraft launcher with a built in mod manager. As such it can be used to install `.mrpack` files.

5. Select the `.mrpack` file with the `Browse` button.

6. Press `Ok` and wait for modpack to be installed.
> [!TIP]
> Additional client side mods can be added to the pack, if desired, at this stage.
> This can be done using the following
> 1. Right click pack and select `Edit`.
> 2. Select the `Mods` menu.
> 3. Mods can be added via the `Download mods` button or by adding the files directly using the `Add file` button.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not press `Check for updates` as this can cause different mod versions to be installed, resulting in incompatability with the server.

> [!NOTE]
> Some installed mods may not update automatically when updating the pack to a new version. Use the `Download all` button in the `Version` tab to force update.

7. Double click the pack to launch the game.
